# UE4-Spinball
Using the Unreal Engine 4 I created a ball physics game similar to Super Monkey Ball

In Spinball players control a very sensitive ball and must navigate an endless track where the edges have no guards. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible while trying to stay alive for as long as possible. Be careful of the edges as if you fall off you lose the game!

Controls:
WASD: 4 Directionally movement
Space: Jump
